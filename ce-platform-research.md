# CE Registration Platform Competitive Landscape Research
**Prepared for:** Matt, Program Developer at Kirkwood Community College  
**Date:** February 17, 2026  
**Purpose:** Strategic evaluation of building a modern, AI-native CE registration platform  

---

## Executive Summary

The community college continuing education (CE) registration software market is **fragmented but consolidating rapidly**, dominated by one heavyweight (Modern Campus) after its 2022 acquisition of the #2 player (Augusoft/Lumens). The market serves ~1,167 community colleges managing 4.1 million non-credit students — and most are stuck on legacy systems that haven't fundamentally changed in 15+ years.

**The opportunity is real.** Modern Campus is now a monopolist charging premium prices with a product that reviewers consistently call "counter-intuitive," "a work in progress," and full of "workarounds." The #2 and #3 alternatives (Enrole, CampusCE) are small, underfunded challengers. Nobody has built an AI-native platform for this space. The total addressable market for software serving community college CE divisions is conservatively **$50–75M ARR** at current price points, with room to expand.

## 1. Market Context

### Community College Numbers (2024)
- **1,026** AACC member-eligible community colleges (down slightly from 1,038 in 2023)
- **1,167** total public and independent community colleges in the US
- **~1,600** when branch campuses included
- **10.5 million** total headcount enrollment (fall 2024)
  - 6.4 million credit students
  - **4.1 million non-credit students** (the CE market)
- Non-credit enrollment grew **11.7%** year-over-year in fall 2024 — fastest growing segment

### CE Market Size
- US continuing education market: **$66.91 billion** in 2024, projected to **$95.98 billion by 2030** (6.2% CAGR)
- Modern Campus stat: **48% of CE leaders don't know their own enrollment numbers** — speaks to the data chaos in the market
- Augusoft alone processed **$3 billion+ in CE transactions** before acquisition (hundreds of schools, 8M+ students registered)

### TAM Estimate for Registration Software
- ~800–900 community colleges with active CE/workforce divisions needing dedicated software
- Enterprise contracts (Destiny One tier): $25,000–$75,000+/year (estimated; Modern Campus doesn't publish pricing)
- Mid-market contracts (Lumens/Enrole tier): $10,000–$30,000/year
- Budget-market contracts (ACEware, CourseStorm): $3,000–$12,000/year
- **Rough TAM for community college CE software: ~$50–75M/year ARR** (at current pricing)
- Opportunity to expand TAM with AI-powered upsells, marketing automation modules, analytics, corporate training portals

---

### 🏛️ ELLUCIAN LIFELONG LEARNING / JOURNEY (formerly Elevate)
**Website:** ellucian.com  
**The ERP giant's answer — good if you're already on Ellucian, limited otherwise**

#### Company Background
- Ellucian is the dominant ERP vendor for community colleges (Banner and Colleague are the two leading campus SIS systems)
- Historically offered "Elevate" as their CE-specific product
- Now appears to be rebranding/evolving toward "Journey" — an AI-powered lifelong learning module
- "Journey has provided us a new way to connect with lifelong learners" — George Washington University Registrar

#### Key Features (Elevate/Journey)
- CE registration separate from main campus SIS
- Skills mapping: connects CE curriculum to workforce/employer needs (the AI differentiator)
- Course catalog and registration
- Maps to Banner or Colleague
- Non-credit program management

#### Notable Customer
- **Alabama Community College System (ACCS)** — implemented Ellucian Elevate system-wide across their entire state college system
  - Prior to this, colleges had "no capability to do so digitally" for CE registration
  - "Various methods to register students," "slow manual processes," "disparate data"
- **George Washington University** — using Journey

#### Pricing
- Enterprise, quote-based only
- Likely $30,000–$100,000+/year for large system implementations
- Bundle pricing when already paying for Banner/Colleague

#### Strengths
- Deep integration with Banner and Colleague (no data syncing needed)
- State system deals (ACCS proves this works)
- AI skills mapping is genuinely interesting
- Trusted brand in higher ed

#### Weaknesses
- Only valuable if you're on Ellucian's ERP
- Not purpose-built for CE; feels like an add-on
- Less specialized than Destiny One for complex CE workflows
- Bureaucratic vendor; slow to respond to CE-specific needs
- Limited community/reviews for the CE-specific product
- Expensive

---

### 🗂️ JENZABAR SONIS
**Website:** jenzabar.com/product/jenzabar-sonis  
**Full SIS, not CE-specific — CE is an afterthought**

#### Key Points
- Jenzabar SONIS is a student information system for small specialized institutions
- CE is a module, not the core product
- Known issue from a real Capterra review: "We are struggling a little bit in using SonisWeb with our Community Ed/Continuing Ed type courses...When we do registrations it is difficult to determine which section is which because the dates are not shown on the registration screen."
- Not a serious CE-first competitor; relevant only for small institutions that need one system for everything

---

### 🔧 SARS / SARSGrid
**Website:** sarsgrid.com  
**Not really a CE registration competitor — appointment scheduling tool**

- SARS is focused on student appointment scheduling (advising, counseling, tutoring centers)
- 200+ higher education institutions since 1995
- Sometimes mentioned alongside CE software but it's a different category
- Not a direct competitor to CE registration platforms

---

### 🏗️ BANNER / PEOPLESOFT / WORKDAY (ERP CE Modules)
**The main campus SIS — universally inadequate for CE**

#### The Problem
Ellucian's own blog states it bluntly:  
> "Because credit and non-credit systems don't always integrate, you may have to use time-consuming manual processes to manage courses and enrollment. What works for a high school graduate isn't going to work for nontraditional students. And traditional software systems aren't going to work for you."

- Most ERPs treat CE as an afterthought
- Clock hours, non-credit pricing, corporate invoicing, and open enrollment timing don't fit the ERP credit model
- San Diego Community College District: used custom-built non-credit application on top of PeopleSoft
- Nearly every community college using Banner or PeopleSoft also needs a separate CE-specific system

---

## 3. Pain Points Deep Dive

### What CE Directors Actually Complain About

**1. UI/UX is Stuck in 2005**
- Destiny One: "The UI can be terribly counter-intuitive" (Capterra)
- ACEware: Desktop-first software, bolt-on web
- Banner CE: Not designed for web-based self-service at all
- Students expect Amazon-quality registration; they get DMV quality

**2. No Real Mobile Experience**
- Most CE platforms are responsive but not mobile-first
- Students increasingly register on phones; many legacy platforms fail here
- CourseStorm does this well; Destiny One does not

**3. Reporting is a Nightmare**
- 48% of CE leaders "do NOT know their enrollment numbers" (Modern Campus's own stat — remarkable)
- Destiny One complaints: Can't pull instructor pay vs. enrollment revenue reports easily
- Can't pull group/invoice reports effectively
- Data lives in silos — CE system, Banner, Salesforce, Excel all have different numbers
- No predictive analytics or program-level insights

**4. No Integrated Marketing Automation**
- Email newsletters: usually manual or requires a separate tool (Mailchimp, Constant Contact)
- No automated abandoned registration sequences
- No SMS/text messaging for class reminders, registration nudges, waitlist notifications
- No behavior-based triggers ("student browsed cybersecurity courses 3x — send email")
- CourseStorm has basic marketing email tools; none have true automation

**5. Corporate/B2B Training Portal is Weak or Missing**
- Workforce development requires: corporate account management, purchase orders, bulk registration, invoice billing
- Destiny One has Corporate Engagement Manager module — but reviewers note it's complex
- Most other platforms can't handle B2B at all
- Companies want a portal where HR can manage their employees' training

**6. Youth Programs Are a Pain**
- Community education runs youth camps, after-school programs
- Most CE platforms require workarounds for guardian registration, age restrictions, emergency contacts
- CourseStorm handles this relatively well; others don't

**7. The Workaround Culture**
- "My teams (registrar, marketing, IT, academics) are constantly figuring out workarounds because Destiny does not have the features necessary to support their work." — SoftwareAdvice
- ACEware: Known for users who hack the system with custom reports
- Staff waste hours weekly on manual processes that should be automated

**8. Upgrades Break Things**
- Destiny One: "Upgrades can break procedures that were previously working" — Capterra
- This is a sign of poor software engineering; tech debt accumulated over 20 years

**9. Implementation Takes Forever**
- Destiny One implementations: 6–12 months typical
- Enrole pitches 60–90 days as a differentiator — and it's working
- ACEware SaaS: unknown

**10. Vendor Lock-In + Pricing Power**
- Once you're on Destiny One, switching costs are enormous (data migration, retraining)
- Modern Campus knows this and prices accordingly
- Small programs can't afford Destiny One; they're stuck on ACEware or spreadsheets

## 5. Strategic Questions Answered

### Is There a Dominant Player?
**Yes — Modern Campus is dominant after the Augusoft acquisition, but not unassailable.**
- They now control approximately 60–70% of the purpose-built CE software market (estimated)
- But their monopoly power is driving pricing up and feature development down
- Reviewers consistently say the product feels like "a work in progress"
- Post-acquisition integration is messy — Destiny One and Lumens users are uncertain about the roadmap

### What's the Average Contract Value?
- **Enterprise (Destiny One tier):** $25,000–$75,000+/year (estimated; not published)
- **Mid-market (Lumens/Enrole/CampusCE tier):** $10,000–$30,000/year (estimated)
- **Budget (ACEware, CourseStorm for CE):** $3,000–$12,000/year
- Implementation fees are additional: $10,000–$50,000 for enterprise

### What Would Make Someone Switch?
From the review patterns and pain points, the top switching triggers are:
1. **Price increase** — Modern Campus raising prices post-acquisition
2. **Poor support** — feeling unheard or deprioritized
3. **Upgrade breaks critical workflow** — immediate crisis trigger
4. **New leadership** at CE division who did the research elsewhere
5. **Modern UX** — staff turnover brings in younger admins who demand better tools
6. **AI/automation promise** — "we can save you 15+ hours/week" (Enrole's positioning)

### Is Anyone Building AI-Native in This Space?
**No. Not yet.**
- Ellucian's "Journey" has skills mapping that uses some intelligence, but it's not core registration
- CourseStorm added "AI-powered reporting" to their Premium tier — likely basic
- No platform has: conversational enrollment assistant, predictive fill/cancel modeling, behavior-based marketing automation, intelligent program recommendations
- This is a **wide-open gap**

### Sales Cycle to Community Colleges?
- **Typical: 6–18 months** (6 months for smaller decisions, 12–18 months for enterprise)
- Decision-making process: CE Dean/Director identifies need → IT evaluates → Finance approves → sometimes VP/Provost → Board approval for large contracts
- RFP process often required for contracts >$10,000–$25,000 (varies by state)
- **Relationship-driven**: "Long-term relationships are essential. The worst thing a company can do is not retain their best representatives." (Inside Higher Ed)
- Conference presence (LERN, NCCET, AACC) is critical for discovery

### State-Level Purchasing Agreements That Matter
- **California:** FoundationCCC's CollegeBuys program — negotiated technology contracts with "piggyback" provisions allowing other institutions to use the same pricing. Critical for the 115 California community colleges.
- **E&I Cooperative Services** — nationwide non-profit cooperative for education procurement; getting on their contract list is a significant business accelerator
- **NASPO ValuePoint** — another national cooperative purchasing program used by public institutions
- **Texas DIR (Department of Information Resources)** — Texas colleges often use state contracts
- **Key insight:** Getting on a state cooperative contract can open doors to dozens of institutions at once. California alone has 115 community colleges.

---

## 6. Startup/New Entrant Analysis

### Who's Trying to Enter This Space?
- **Enrole (Entrinsik)** — the most credible challenger; modern platform, Ellucian certified, Wake Tech as marquee customer
- **CampusCE** — integration-focused, smaller operation
- No VC-funded startups have targeted this exact market (as of early 2026)
- General edtech startups (Coursera, LinkedIn Learning, etc.) are in adjacent spaces but not CE registration

### Why Hasn't a Modern Startup Won Yet?
1. **Long sales cycles** — 12–18 months to close deals; burns runway
2. **Integration requirements** — must connect to Banner or Colleague; complex APIs
3. **Regulatory complexity** — FERPA, PCI DSS, state compliance
4. **Niche market** — ~1,000 prospects is small for a VC-backed startup
5. **Low awareness** — CE directors are not reading TechCrunch; they're at LERN conferences
6. **Sticky customers** — once on Destiny One, switching costs are high

### Why a Founder WITH DOMAIN EXPERTISE Has an Advantage
- Matt's 15 years at Kirkwood is the ultimate unfair advantage
- Knows the buyers personally (and knows people who know the buyers at 500 other colleges)
- Knows the actual workflows (course approvals, corporate invoicing, instructor pay, compliance)
- Can get early reference customers through personal relationships
- Conference presence is credible (peer selling, not vendor selling)

## 7. The Opportunity — Feature Priorities

Based on the gap analysis, here's what an AI-native CE platform should nail first:

### Tier 1: Table Stakes (Must Have at Launch)
1. **Online course catalog + registration** — beautiful, mobile-first UX
2. **Payment processing** — integrated Stripe, payment plans, refunds, discount codes
3. **Waitlist management** — automated waitlist → enrollment notifications
4. **Basic reporting** — enrollment numbers, revenue, section fill rates
5. **Instructor management** — roster access, pay calculations, communication tools
6. **Banner/Colleague integration** — bidirectional sync for institutions on Ellucian
7. **FERPA compliance + PCI DSS**

### Tier 2: Differentiators (Win Deals)
8. **Marketing automation** — email sequences, abandoned registration recovery, segmentation
9. **SMS/text messaging** — registration confirmations, reminders, waitlist alerts
10. **Corporate training portal** — company accounts, PO/invoice billing, bulk enrollment
11. **AI-powered reporting** — "Your cybersecurity courses are consistently 40% full; here's why + what to do"
12. **Fast implementation** — 30–60 days vs. 6–12 months for competitors
13. **Modern admin UX** — if staff love using it, they'll advocate for it

### Tier 3: Moat-Building (Long-Term)
14. **Conversational enrollment assistant** — "Help me find a course that fits my schedule and career goals"
15. **Predictive analytics** — fill rate forecasting, cancellation risk, optimal pricing
16. **Behavior-based personalization** — course recommendations based on student history
17. **Skills mapping** — connect CE courses to job market demand (labor market API integration)
18. **Multi-department support** — CE, Workforce Dev, Corporate Training, Community Ed, Youth Programs all in one

---

## 8. Business Model Considerations

### Pricing Model Options
1. **Annual SaaS subscription** (Destiny One model) — predictable, high ACV, longer sales cycle
2. **Per-student/transaction** (CourseStorm model) — low barrier to entry, scales with volume
3. **Tiered flat fee** — aligned with institution size (FTE, enrollment count, revenue)
4. **Freemium + upgrade** — free tier for small programs to build virality

**Recommended:** Start with **annual SaaS subscription** ($15,000–$40,000/year based on size) to build predictable ARR. Consider a starter tier at $5,000–$8,000 to reach smaller programs ACEware serves.

### Go-to-Market Strategy
- **Year 1:** 5–10 beta customers (peer colleges; Kirkwood connections give you a shortlist)
- **Distribution channels:** LERN Annual Conference (Nov), NCCET, AACC, state community college associations
- **Reference customer strategy:** One marquee Midwest community college (ideally a named, well-regarded institution) as the showcase
- **Content:** Blog, newsletter, podcast targeting CE directors — build thought leadership before product is ready
- **Get on E&I Cooperative** (takes time but unlocks national procurement)

## 9. Risk Factors

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|------------|
| Modern Campus copies AI features | Medium-High | Move fast; depth of AI integration matters |
| Sales cycle kills runway | High | Start with warm network; charge from day 1 |
| Integration complexity with Banner/Colleague | High | Hire someone who has done Ellucian APIs |
| FERPA/PCI compliance burden | Medium | Build compliance in from day 1 |
| Market too small for VC | Medium | Target profitability at 50 customers, not 5,000 |
| Switching costs too high for prospects | Medium | Offer free data migration assistance |
| Buyers stuck in state purchasing process | Medium | Get on cooperative purchasing contracts early |

## 10. Bottom Line Verdict

**The market is ready for disruption. Here's why:**

1. **Modern Campus is the monopolist** — pricing power without proportional value delivery
2. **The product is genuinely bad** — real users say it's counter-intuitive, buggy, and full of workarounds
3. **Nobody is building AI-native** — the gap is wide open and AI could meaningfully improve CE operations
4. **4.1 million non-credit students** are registered through clunky, outdated platforms
5. **Matt has the insider advantage** — 15 years of domain expertise is worth more than $5M in market research

**The case against building:**
1. Sales cycles are long (12–18 months to enterprise deals)
2. Integration work is real (Banner/Colleague are painful APIs)
3. Market size is modest — 1,000 prospects means a $50–75M ARR ceiling as CE-only
4. Modern Campus will eventually improve their product

**Verdict:** The opportunity is real and the timing is good, especially for a founder with direct domain expertise and existing relationships. The AI angle is the differentiator that justifies building now vs. 5 years ago. If Matt can get 3–5 committed early adopters from his network before writing a line of code, this is worth pursuing.
