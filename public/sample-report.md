# Executive Summary

## Recommendation: **GO** ✓

Based on comprehensive analysis across market demand, competitive landscape, curriculum viability, financial projections, and marketing opportunity, we **strongly recommend** Midwest Community College proceed with launching a Cybersecurity Certificate Program for Fall 2026.

### Key Findings

- **Explosive demand:** The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects **33% growth** for Information Security Analysts from 2023–2033, far outpacing the 4% average for all occupations. There are currently **over 500,000 unfilled cybersecurity positions** in the United States.
- **Strong wages:** Entry-level cybersecurity roles in the Midwest command **$55,000–$72,000** annually, with median salaries for experienced analysts at **$112,000** nationally.
- **Limited local competition:** Only 2 institutions within a 60-mile radius offer comparable non-credit cybersecurity certificates, and neither align with current industry certification frameworks (CompTIA Security+, CySA+).
- **Favorable economics:** With a $75,000 startup investment, the program is projected to **break even within 3 cohorts** (12 months) and generate a **5-year ROI of 340%**.
- **Industry alignment:** Employer demand surveys indicate 78% of regional IT hiring managers would value a CompTIA Security+-aligned certificate when screening candidates.

### Investment Summary

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Startup Investment | $75,000 |
| Annual Operating Cost | $48,000 |
| Revenue per Cohort (20 students) | $59,000 |
| Break-even | Cohort 3 (Month 12) |
| 5-Year Net Revenue | $255,000 |
| 5-Year ROI | 340% |

# Competitive Landscape

## Regional Program Scan

A comprehensive scan of cybersecurity education offerings within a 75-mile radius identified the following:

### Direct Competitors

**1. Metro Area Community College — Cybersecurity AAS Degree**
- **Format:** 2-year Associate of Applied Science
- **Cost:** ~$8,400 (64 credits at in-state tuition)
- **Timeline:** 4 semesters minimum
- **Certifications:** None specifically aligned
- **Enrollment:** ~45 students/year
- **Weakness:** Too long for career changers; credit-based, not workforce-focused

**2. Regional Technical Institute — IT Security Certificate**
- **Format:** 12-week evening program
- **Cost:** $3,200
- **Timeline:** One semester
- **Certifications:** Vendor-specific (Cisco)
- **Enrollment:** ~15 students/cohort, 2 cohorts/year
- **Weakness:** Narrow focus on Cisco products; limited industry recognition

**3. Online Bootcamps (Coursera, edX, SANS)**
- **Format:** Self-paced or cohort-based online
- **Cost:** $500–$8,000+
- **Timeline:** Variable
- **Certifications:** Platform certificates (not industry-recognized)
- **Weakness:** Low completion rates (15–25%); no hands-on lab experience; no local employer relationships

### Competitive Gap Analysis
