## 2. Competitive Landscape

### Regional Training Providers

| Provider | Program | Duration | Cost | Format |
|----------|---------|----------|------|--------|
| No direct competitor found | — | — | — | — |
| Regional trade union programs | Apprenticeship | 3-4 years | Free (union) | In-person |
| Equipment manufacturer training | Product-specific | 1-3 days | $500-2,000 | In-person |
| SSPC online courses | Individual courses | Self-paced | $200-800/course | Online |

### Competitive Advantage

**No community college within 200 miles currently offers a dedicated industrial coatings certificate.** This represents a first-mover opportunity.

Key differentiators for the proposed program:
- **Comprehensive curriculum** covering multiple coating systems (vs. product-specific vendor training)
- **Industry certifications included** (SSPC, OSHA, EPA — saves students $2,000+ in separate certification costs)
- **12-week accelerated format** (vs. 3-4 year apprenticeship)
- **Hybrid delivery** enables broader geographic reach
- **Community college pricing** ($2,800 vs. $5,000-12,000 for private training)
